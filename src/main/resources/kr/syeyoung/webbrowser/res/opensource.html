<br/>GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
<br/>Version 3, 29 June 2007
<br/>
<br/>Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <a href="http://fsf.org/"> http://fsf.org/ </a>
<br/>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
<br/>of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
<br/>
<br/>Preamble
<br/>
<br/>The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
<br/>software and other kinds of works.
<br/>
<br/>The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
<br/>to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
<br/>the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
<br/>share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
<br/>software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
<br/>GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
<br/>any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
<br/>your programs, too.
<br/>
<br/>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
<br/>price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
<br/>have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
<br/>them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
<br/>want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
<br/>free programs, and that you know you can do these things.
<br/>
<br/>To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
<br/>these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
<br/>certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
<br/>you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.
<br/>
<br/>For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
<br/>gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
<br/>freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
<br/>or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
<br/>know their rights.
<br/>
<br/>Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
<br/>(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
<br/>giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.
<br/>
<br/>For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
<br/>that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
<br/>authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
<br/>changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
<br/>authors of previous versions.
<br/>
<br/>Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
<br/>modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
<br/>can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
<br/>protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
<br/>pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
<br/>use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
<br/>have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
<br/>products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
<br/>stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
<br/>of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.
<br/>
<br/>Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
<br/>States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
<br/>software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
<br/>avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
<br/>make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
<br/>patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.
<br/>
<br/>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
<br/>modification follow.
<br/>
<br/>TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br/>
<br/>0. Definitions.
<br/>
<br/>"This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
<br/>
<br/>"Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
<br/>works, such as semiconductor masks.
<br/>
<br/>"The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
<br/>License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
<br/>"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.
<br/>
<br/>To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
<br/>in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
<br/>exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
<br/>earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.
<br/>
<br/>A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
<br/>on the Program.
<br/>
<br/>To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
<br/>permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
<br/>infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
<br/>computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
<br/>distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
<br/>public, and in some countries other activities as well.
<br/>
<br/>To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
<br/>parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
<br/>a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.
<br/>
<br/>An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
<br/>to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
<br/>feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
<br/>tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
<br/>extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
<br/>work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
<br/>the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
<br/>menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.
<br/>
<br/>1. Source Code.
<br/>
<br/>The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
<br/>for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
<br/>form of a work.
<br/>
<br/>A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
<br/>standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
<br/>interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
<br/>is widely used among developers working in that language.
<br/>
<br/>The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
<br/>than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
<br/>packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
<br/>Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
<br/>Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
<br/>implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
<br/>"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
<br/>(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
<br/>(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
<br/>produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.
<br/>
<br/>The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
<br/>the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
<br/>work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
<br/>control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
<br/>System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
<br/>programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
<br/>which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
<br/>includes interface definition files associated with source files for
<br/>the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
<br/>linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
<br/>such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
<br/>subprograms and other parts of the work.
<br/>
<br/>The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
<br/>can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
<br/>Source.
<br/>
<br/>The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
<br/>same work.
<br/>
<br/>2. Basic Permissions.
<br/>
<br/>All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
<br/>copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
<br/>conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
<br/>permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
<br/>covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
<br/>content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
<br/>rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.
<br/>
<br/>You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
<br/>convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
<br/>in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
<br/>of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
<br/>with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
<br/>the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
<br/>not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
<br/>for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
<br/>and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
<br/>your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.
<br/>
<br/>Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
<br/>the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
<br/>makes it unnecessary.
<br/>
<br/>3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
<br/>
<br/>No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
<br/>measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
<br/>11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
<br/>similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
<br/>measures.
<br/>
<br/>When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
<br/>circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
<br/>is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
<br/>the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
<br/>modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
<br/>users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
<br/>technological measures.
<br/>
<br/>4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
<br/>
<br/>You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
<br/>receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
<br/>appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
<br/>keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
<br/>non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
<br/>keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
<br/>recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.
<br/>
<br/>You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
<br/>and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.
<br/>
<br/>5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
<br/>
<br/>You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
<br/>produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
<br/>terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
<br/>
<br/>a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
<br/>it, and giving a relevant date.
<br/>
<br/>b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
<br/>released under this License and any conditions added under section
<br/>7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
<br/>"keep intact all notices".
<br/>
<br/>c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
<br/>License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
<br/>License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
<br/>additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
<br/>regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
<br/>permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
<br/>invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
<br/>
<br/>d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
<br/>Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
<br/>interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
<br/>work need not make them do so.
<br/>
<br/>A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
<br/>works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
<br/>and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
<br/>in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
<br/>"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
<br/>used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
<br/>beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
<br/>in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
<br/>parts of the aggregate.
<br/>
<br/>6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
<br/>
<br/>You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
<br/>of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
<br/>machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
<br/>in one of these ways:
<br/>
<br/>a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
<br/>(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
<br/>Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
<br/>customarily used for software interchange.
<br/>
<br/>b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
<br/>(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
<br/>written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
<br/>long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
<br/>model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
<br/>copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
<br/>product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
<br/>medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
<br/>more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
<br/>conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
<br/>Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.
<br/>
<br/>c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
<br/>written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
<br/>alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
<br/>only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
<br/>with subsection 6b.
<br/>
<br/>d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
<br/>place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
<br/>Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
<br/>further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
<br/>Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
<br/>copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
<br/>may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
<br/>that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
<br/>clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
<br/>Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
<br/>Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
<br/>available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
<br/>
<br/>e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
<br/>you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
<br/>Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
<br/>charge under subsection 6d.
<br/>
<br/>A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
<br/>from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
<br/>included in conveying the object code work.
<br/>
<br/>A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
<br/>tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
<br/>or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
<br/>into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
<br/>doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
<br/>product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
<br/>typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
<br/>of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
<br/>actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
<br/>is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
<br/>commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
<br/>the only significant mode of use of the product.
<br/>
<br/>"Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
<br/>procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
<br/>and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
<br/>a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
<br/>suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
<br/>code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
<br/>modification has been made.
<br/>
<br/>If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
<br/>specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
<br/>part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
<br/>User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
<br/>fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
<br/>Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
<br/>by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
<br/>if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
<br/>modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
<br/>been installed in ROM).
<br/>
<br/>The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
<br/>requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
<br/>for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
<br/>the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
<br/>network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
<br/>adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
<br/>protocols for communication across the network.
<br/>
<br/>Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
<br/>in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
<br/>documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
<br/>source code form), and must require no special password or key for
<br/>unpacking, reading or copying.
<br/>
<br/>7. Additional Terms.
<br/>
<br/>"Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
<br/>License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
<br/>Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
<br/>be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
<br/>that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
<br/>apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
<br/>under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
<br/>this License without regard to the additional permissions.
<br/>
<br/>When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
<br/>remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
<br/>it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
<br/>removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
<br/>additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
<br/>for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.
<br/>
<br/>Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
<br/>add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
<br/>that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:
<br/>
<br/>a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
<br/>terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
<br/>
<br/>b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
<br/>author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
<br/>Notices displayed by works containing it; or
<br/>
<br/>c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
<br/>requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
<br/>reasonable ways as different from the original version; or
<br/>
<br/>d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
<br/>authors of the material; or
<br/>
<br/>e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
<br/>trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or
<br/>
<br/>f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
<br/>material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
<br/>it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
<br/>any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
<br/>those licensors and authors.
<br/>
<br/>All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
<br/>restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
<br/>received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
<br/>governed by this License along with a term that is a further
<br/>restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
<br/>a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
<br/>License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
<br/>of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
<br/>not survive such relicensing or conveying.
<br/>
<br/>If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
<br/>must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
<br/>additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
<br/>where to find the applicable terms.
<br/>
<br/>Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
<br/>form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
<br/>the above requirements apply either way.
<br/>
<br/>8. Termination.
<br/>
<br/>You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
<br/>provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
<br/>modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
<br/>this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
<br/>paragraph of section 11).
<br/>
<br/>However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
<br/>license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
<br/>provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
<br/>finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
<br/>holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
<br/>prior to 60 days after the cessation.
<br/>
<br/>Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
<br/>reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
<br/>violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
<br/>received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
<br/>copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
<br/>your receipt of the notice.
<br/>
<br/>Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
<br/>licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
<br/>this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
<br/>reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
<br/>material under section 10.
<br/>
<br/>9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
<br/>
<br/>You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
<br/>run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
<br/>occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
<br/>to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
<br/>nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
<br/>modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
<br/>not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
<br/>covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.
<br/>
<br/>10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
<br/>
<br/>Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
<br/>receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
<br/>propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
<br/>for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
<br/>
<br/>An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
<br/>organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
<br/>organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
<br/>work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
<br/>transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
<br/>licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
<br/>give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
<br/>Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
<br/>the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.
<br/>
<br/>You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
<br/>rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
<br/>not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
<br/>rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
<br/>(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
<br/>any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
<br/>sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.
<br/>
<br/>11. Patents.
<br/>
<br/>A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
<br/>License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
<br/>work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".
<br/>
<br/>A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
<br/>owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
<br/>hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
<br/>by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
<br/>but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
<br/>consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
<br/>purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
<br/>patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
<br/>this License.
<br/>
<br/>Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
<br/>patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
<br/>make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
<br/>propagate the contents of its contributor version.
<br/>
<br/>In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
<br/>agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
<br/>(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
<br/>sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
<br/>party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
<br/>patent against the party.
<br/>
<br/>If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
<br/>and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
<br/>to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
<br/>publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
<br/>then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
<br/>available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
<br/>patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
<br/>consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
<br/>license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
<br/>actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
<br/>covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
<br/>in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
<br/>country that you have reason to believe are valid.
<br/>
<br/>If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
<br/>arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
<br/>covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
<br/>receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
<br/>or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
<br/>you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
<br/>work and works based on it.
<br/>
<br/>A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
<br/>the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
<br/>conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
<br/>specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
<br/>work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
<br/>in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
<br/>to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
<br/>the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
<br/>parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
<br/>patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
<br/>conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
<br/>for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
<br/>contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
<br/>or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.
<br/>
<br/>Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
<br/>any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
<br/>otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.
<br/>
<br/>12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.
<br/>
<br/>If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
<br/>otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
<br/>excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
<br/>covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
<br/>License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
<br/>not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
<br/>to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
<br/>the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
<br/>License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.
<br/>
<br/>13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.
<br/>
<br/>Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
<br/>permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
<br/>under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
<br/>combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
<br/>License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
<br/>but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
<br/>section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
<br/>combination as such.
<br/>
<br/>14. Revised Versions of this License.
<br/>
<br/>The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
<br/>the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
<br/>be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
<br/>address new problems or concerns.
<br/>
<br/>Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
<br/>Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
<br/>Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
<br/>option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
<br/>version or of any later version published by the Free Software
<br/>Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
<br/>GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
<br/>by the Free Software Foundation.
<br/>
<br/>If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
<br/>versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
<br/>public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
<br/>to choose that version for the Program.
<br/>
<br/>Later license versions may give you additional or different
<br/>permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
<br/>author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
<br/>later version.
<br/>
<br/>15. Disclaimer of Warranty.
<br/>
<br/>THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
<br/>APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
<br/>HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
<br/>OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
<br/>THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
<br/>PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
<br/>IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
<br/>ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
<br/>
<br/>16. Limitation of Liability.
<br/>
<br/>IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
<br/>WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
<br/>THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
<br/>GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
<br/>USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
<br/>DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
<br/>PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
<br/>EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
<br/>SUCH DAMAGES.
<br/>
<br/>17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
<br/>
<br/>If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
<br/>above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
<br/>reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
<br/>an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
<br/>Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
<br/>copy of the Program in return for a fee.
<br/>
<br/>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br/>
<br/>How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
<br/>
<br/>If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
<br/>possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
<br/>free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
<br/>
<br/>To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
<br/>to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
<br/>state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
<br/>the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
<br/>
<br/>&lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;
<br/>Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author>
<br/>
<br/>    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
<br/>    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
<br/>    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
<br/>    (at your option) any later version.
<br/>
<br/>    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
<br/>    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
<br/>    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
<br/>    GNU General Public License for more details.
<br/>
<br/>    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
<br/>    along with this program.  If not, see <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/">http://www.gnu.org/licenses/</a>.
<br/>
<br/>    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
<br/>
<br/>    If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
<br/>    notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:
<br/>
<br/>&lt;program>  Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;
<br/>        This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
<br/>        This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
<br/>        under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
<br/>
<br/>        The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
<br/>        parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands
<br/>        might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".
<br/>
<br/>        You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
<br/>        if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.
<br/>        For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see
<br/>        <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/">http://www.gnu.org/licenses/</a>.
<br/>
<br/>        The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
<br/>        into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you
<br/>        may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with
<br/>        the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
<br/>        Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read
<br/>        <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html">http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html</a>.
